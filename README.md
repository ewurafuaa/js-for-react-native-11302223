EXPLANATION
--TASK 1 (Process Array)--
The aim of this task is to square even numbers that have been inputted and multiply inputted odd numbers by three. In this task, each number in the array is iterated an operation is applied based on whether the number is even or odd. This is accomplished using a mapping function to generate a new array with the transformed values.

--TASK 2 (Format Array Strings)--
This task aims to modify an array of strings according to a corresponding array of numbers. For even numbers, the strings are capitalized; for odd numbers, they are converted to lowercase.
Implementation: The process entails iterating over each string in the array and applying a formatting rule determined by the parity of the corresponding number in the provided array. This is achieved by mapping each string to its formatted version based on the associated number.
Task 3: Create User Profiles
Objective: This task involves creating user profiles using two arrays of names: the original names and their modified versions (as processed in Task 2). Each user profile consists of an original name, a modified name, and a unique identifier.
Implementation: The process begins by ensuring the equality of the lengths of the two arrays. Subsequently, each original name is mapped to a user profile object, where the modified name is paired with the original name along with an auto-incremented ID. This results in an array of user profiles representing the provided data.
