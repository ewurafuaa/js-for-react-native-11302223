EXPLANATION
--TASK 1 (Process Array)--
The aim of this task is to square even numbers that have been inputted and multiply inputted odd numbers by three. In this task, each number in the array is iterated an operation is applied based on whether the number is even or odd. This is accomplished using a mapping function to generate a new array with the transformed values.

--TASK 2 (Format Array Strings)--
This task aims to modify an array of strings according to a corresponding array of numbers. For even numbers in the array of numbers, the strings are capitalized; for odd numbers in that array, they are converted to lowercase. So in this task, strings in the array are iterated and the corresponding number in the numbers array determines ho the strings in the string array will be displayed. 

--TASK 3 (Create User Profiles) --
With this task, user profiles are created using two arrays of names; the original names and their modified versions based on Task 2. So each user profile consists of an original name, a modified name, and a unique identifier. This is done by making sure the lengths of both arrays are equal firstly, then by making sure that each original name is mapped to a user profile object, where the modified name is paired with the original name along with an auto-incremented ID. This gives us an array of user profiles based on the data provided.
